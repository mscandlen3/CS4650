If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.

For conjugating, I struggle with this too and I've been using **Conjuguemos** lately. Read the lessons first:  [https://conjuguemos.com/tenses/spanish/](https://conjuguemos.com/tenses/spanish/) and then, make an account and do the quizzes. I personally do it over and over again until I get at least 95% of correct answers before moving on to the next quizz.

Then,  go on **Lang-8** ([https://lang-8.com/](https://lang-8.com/)). You can write short texts and native speakers will correct it for you. Try to make simple sentences with the new conjugations you learned. If your vocabulary is limited, look up for new words on [https://www.wordreference.com](https://www.wordreference.com/).

Download **Anki** ([https://www.ankiapp.com/](https://www.ankiapp.com/)). Every time you're learning something new (whether this is from Duolingo, Pimsleur, Conjuguemos, Lang-8 or Wordreference), add a flash card on this app. Try to practice with the flash cards every day.

Then, you need to practice and practice. You can chat with native speakers on the app **Hello Pal** ([https://www.hellopal.com/?lang=fr](https://www.hellopal.com/?lang=fr)) (it could be hard at first if you're a beginner but you'll see that the same sentences will always pop up \[A qué te dedicas, dónde vives, cuántos años tienes, etc\]) (Another note on Hello Pal, if you're a girl, you'll only get men trying to flirt. As you're a teenager, that wouldn't be ideal… Maybe put your profile as a boy to avoid that?).

Hazzatr0n,learner (españa),"I know you've already got a lot of replies, but anyway. I would say that accents are the same as English speakers using text speech like ""u"" and ""ur"". You would only really omit accents if you were speaking to friends. Saying that I have friends that get angry when I miss out accents like I also have English friends that hate when I type in text form.

I would say that missing out accents is a similar offence as using the wrong ""where"" and ""were"" and small grammar offences. In a literal sense, they can change the meaning of the sentence but everyone still will understand you.

For example, ""Hablo ingles"" = I speak groins/crotches. ""Hablo inglés"" = I speak English.

TL;DR: skipping accents are like using text speech. They can change the meaning but everyone will still get you.

As it turned out, high school language education leaves a lot to be desired. After four years of being made to write essays and read poetry, I still couldn’t carry a conversation or, you know, order at a restaurant, because that’s not important or anything /s.

As an adult I went back to it just because I wished I were better at languages, this time with help from the internet and a Spanish teacher (who, amazingly, is Colombian descent, but has German citizenship and is fluent in French too), and it’s so much better. I’m now fully conversational, even on the phone, and my iPhone language is actually set to Spanish   Understanding TV shows is the ultimate goal but one thing at a time 👍 ",1,1550542521,FALSE,t3_as2aza,FALSE,t3_as2aza,/r/Spanish/comments/as2aza/why_did_you_learn_spanish/egrua7r/,5,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE
canonhourglass,🇺🇸 learner,"I took four years of Spanish in high school — and was never all that good at it. I feel that much of the language education I had was based on memorization of grammar rules for two years and then off to reading Miguel de Unamuno, or Cervantes in the original medieval-period Spanish, and then writing a five-page essay about it. After four years I’d somehow bumbled my way through that, but in no way could I have ordered anything at a restaurant or asked for directions, etc.

Fast forward to adulthood — I found that I could formulate sentences and even have a decent accent (I’m a musically-inclined person who has an ear for melody and I’m a good mimic which I think helps) but really had trouble with listening comprehension. So I set out to work on that — this time with a tutor. And just as in music, where good musicians are also good listeners of music, good speakers get that way by deliberate listening. So I listen to the internet (Easy Spanish is a great intermediate-level YouTube channel focusing on Mexican Spanish with a lot of natural content), etc. I now don’t need a translator at work, even on the phone, and recently had a Lyft driver who primarily spoke Spanish and had a full-on natural conversation as if we were speaking English.

The internet today provides so many more resources than we had when I was in high school — back then, the only audio content would have been either nothing or lightning-fast news and variety shows where it’s impossible for a beginner to follow along. And on top of that, high school textbooks in Spanish — at least the ones we had — were...all in Spanish. So if you were confused about something, you couldn’t even understand the explanation! The rationale was something something immersion something something hit the ground running something something here’s high level poetry write me an essay. But don’t worry about ordering a coffee in a cafe in CDMX. Let’s explore the themes of alienation in Gabriel García Marquez’ work instead.

Now you can go into the internet and listen to a variety of content with varying levels of difficulty, and there are even videos that will explain concepts that are sort of foreign to native English speakers — like the subjunctive, for example, in a way that make sense in our heads. It’s really a great time to be learning languages and now I feel like I can actually call Spanish my second language 👍 ",1,1551720867,FALSE,t3_ax7ql8,TRUE,t3_ax7ql8,/r/Spanish/comments/ax7ql8/what_types_of_learning_environmentspeople_made/ehs28nw/,2,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE
Soy_Mono,learner (more or less b2 i guess),"yo, you just need to speak and nothing else. Practice speaking. You can't just expect to suddenly know what to talk when you usually don't (yeah I know you have a lot of ideas in English but you can't convert it to Spanish, hence the only short responses). I tell you what, just try express the ideas you have in mind, even if they sound silly or even when your lack of vocab makes it hard to express. But who cares, people know you are learning, they are more than happy to wait you patiently to listen to what you would want to say. Especially you have a native speaker to practice with. Just talk to your Mexican friend, even if you sound like a kindergarten kid trying to talk to an adult, you just need to do it. The fact is you are most likely at the level of a native Spanish kindergarten speaking the language. 


I was so bad in pronunciation (I could not pronounce ""r"" and ""l"" properly, just to name one. And a lot more problems). So I decided to stay quiet in class, preventing to talk. Did it help me? No. And it changed when I went to Spain as an exchange student. I had to speak spanish to survive, even if I spoke like a retard. And I made friends with some Mexicanas who would always hang out with me, leading me to speak more Spanish in the process. Did it help? Yes.


Now don't think of my story as: ""well you went to Spain of course your speaking improve"". Nah, I mean I could have stayed inside the apartment all days. That way, my Spanish wouldn't have improved. I went out to make friends and socialize. I forced myself to use the language. So here's what you need to do: force yourself to use the language.

I'll also recommend that one, I use it myself for Spanish and it's pretty good, I think.

Biggest problem is that they don't give you much room to grow with the daily lessons alone, which is the only thing I can use, since I'm not buying the membership. The words they choose are the same for the entire day, no matter how long you've been using it. Raising the difficulty doesn't help either, it just asks you to type words out more often.

Overall, it's a good place to start, but I'm slowly losing the usefullness of it, since they teach very basic vocabulary.

Shinsync,learner,"Here's some differences I've personally noticed that aren't your usual distinción vs seseo. 

Vowel differences:

1. In Spain, *e* is always pronounced as an closed-mid vowel, /e/. In much of northern/central Latin America is realized more as an open-mid front unrounded vowel, /ɛ/.

2. In Spain, *a* is always an open central vowel. In Latin America, you'll hear it tend more toward an open front vowel, more like Italian. 

3. In Spain, the short *i* sound is realized as something close to a near-close front unrounded vowel, /ɪ/, in slow speech. It's not exactly that vowel, of course, but it sort of tends toward it. There might be an IPA symbol for the sound I'm talking about, but you'll have to forgive me because I don't know it. I think my explanation is good for getting an idea of what I mean, though. 

4. Spanish in Spain (except like the Canary Islands) has a remarkably flat intonation. The pitch only ever changes when it falls after a stressed syllable, very much like Japanese. All other vowels are equal in length and flat-pitched. In Latin America, pitch can shift within even monophthong vowels, for reasons that I haven't studied and hence don't know, which is why Latin American Spanish is often seen as more melodic compared to its flatter Spanish counterpart. 

Consonant differences:

1. In Spain, fricatives are tight (except Andalucía). In Latin America, they tend to be a bit more open. (For example, when *d* is realized as /ð/, the tongue is closer to the teeth in Spain than in Latin America. In parts of Spain with yeísmo, the same applies to *y* and *ll*.

2. In Spain, the letter *r* is an alveolar tap /ɾ/ in syllable end positions. In Latin America, it is an alveolar trill, /r/. In Spain, it is only a trill if it's the first letter of a word, if there's a double *r*, or, in slow speech, when it follows a voiced fricative.  (At the end of words, it might also sound like a soft, short trill.)

3. In Latin America, *s* is a voiceless alveolar sibilant, /s/, which is the most common ""s"" sound in the world. This is the same sound as the standard English *s*. In Spain, it is realized as a voiceless alveolar *retracted* sibilant, /s̠/.

There are many more differences that overall add up to make the languages sound quite different, but I'm only listing a couple to get my point across. 

Again, remember that this is just my opinion.",0,1556639914,FALSE,t3_bis5d5,TRUE,t1_em4ysxu,/r/Spanish/comments/bis5d5/spanish_learners_out_there_do_you_guys_learn/em5a6o3/,1,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE

Being of Italian decent, I'm very pro-Europe, and the only reason I'm interested in Spanish is because of how much I respect Spain, its history and culture, so it's very natural to me to want to learn Spain Spanish and not Latin American. That is very important to me.

Also, I'm not a huge fan of the way Latin American Spanish sounds, personally. Nothing against it, I think Latin American countries are awesome (I especially think Argentinian accents are really cool), it's just not something I'm personally interested in.

I do think there are a lot of differences. They might not be deep differences, but to me they do sound like very different languages to the ear. That's because of two things that are *very* different in Spain vs Latin America: 1. pronunciation of vowels; 2. intonation. 

Spain Spanish is just way easier and more natural to me.

I understand this completely and I try to avoid the same when liaising with English learners. 

My advice is to try tell them up front. After the hellos or very early exchanges you can say ""forgive my mistakes, I'm learning Spanish and need to practice sharing my thoughts"" (I'm not going to give an exact translation as you may want to tailor it). This may not work all the time but appealing to their patience beforehand may give them pause.

Secondly, I can suggest you learn the phrase for ""that's not quite right, let me try again/let me think it over"" (or similar) when you are bombarded and get confused.

This is so helpful for vocabulary, I do not believe there is a better way to acquire vocab than by reading. Start listening to music and look up the lyrics to improve word reognition. Another good resource for developing listening skills is the News in Slow Spanish podcast. Depending on your skill level, watching netflix in Spanish with Spanish subs can be helpful as well, but if that is too much, start with Youtube videos which are shorter.

If you want a bit more structured instruction for grammatical concepts, Duolingo lets you test out of levels. I would not recommend Duolingo on it's own, but if you combine it with other methods it could be helpful for mastering more complicated grammar.

adventurescout140,advanced,"So, there are ambiguous cases, and upon review I would say this is one of them. But it is not true the sentence looses a lot of intended meaning and I will give an example.

Preterite is appropriate whenever you refer to a finite time period, even if the time period was long and the action was continuous during the specified period. For instance, ""I studied Spanish for 3 years"" would be best written ""Estudie español por 3 años"", despite the fact that 3 years is a long time and you were studying throughout the 3 years, not only at one moment of those 3 years. Likewise, you would probably say ""Estudie espanol en la uni"", even though the act of studying was ostensibly continuous over the course of several years. Saying ""Estudiaba espanol en la uni"" would imply you never finished your course of study. While you might say, ""Yo era profe de español"" you would say ""Fui profe de español por 25 años"".  Preterite can refer to a continuous action *if the action had a finite start and end*.  Preterite can be used in any case where the action was started and completed at specific moments, whether it be 1 minute, 3 years, or a lifetime.

A person's life, ending with their death, is a discrete time period.

Kindle's are a phenomenal tool for language practice because they have a built in Spanish English dictionary and save the words you look up under ""vocabulary builder"" so you can reference them later. I recommend books at the higher end of your reading level. Look up the words you don't know and after each chapter, copy any new vocab you looked up into a quizlet or flashcards so you can continue to study them. Reading will also strengthen your understanding of grammatical concepts (especially ones that don't have an English equivalent like the subjunctive) and ability to apply them.

Learning vocabulary in context is so much easier than trying to memorize vocabulary cards. Follow Spanish language newspapers, listen to Spanish language music, watch youtube videos, consume as much Spanish language media as possible.

Wea :   

¡Que wea! - what the fuck

-Esa wea (that thing)

-Estaba haciendo esa wea de matemáticas ( I was doing that shit for maths)

Que eres weon (you're such an idiot, when with friends) (you're such a cunt , when angry/ formal)

Hola weon , Como estai ( hey bro , how are you)

Chupame el pico, weon (suck it , cunt)

- with friends it almost always means bro or idiot , but in anger or with superiors/formal situations it become similar to cunt.

Mexicans in particular are a little funny about things.

Like, they'll call their friends ""gordo"" or ""chino"", which.. if an American called you fat ass or chink (the equivalents I suppose), it'd be offensive. Nicknames is just how it is in Mexico.


If they call you Cabron, I don't think it is really comparable to ""bastard"". Maybe not as strong as 'bastard' in English.

In English, being called a bastard is like a fighting word. In Spanish, Cabron is thrown away so much and so liberally.. it could mean more like ""that goober"" etc.

lagringuita,learner - b.s. in spanish in progress,"Grr. Lyric translations are the most difficult thing. I’ve done a couple, and it’s frustrating because you’re trying to balance syllable count, rhythm, musical and syllable emphasis, and meaning. Most of the time it’s impossible to do a literal translation because the lyrics won’t line up with the music. For this reason, you often have to do a much looser translation of the ideas. 

If I were translating the song, I would lean more towards the first translation. At least for that stanza, it seems closer to the ideas/emotions. 

Edit: Actually, I wouldn’t choose that first line in the Latin version. It doesn’t work as well with the rhythm as the European version.

You can approach Spanish how you learned Latin, but the main difference is that Spanish is a language that's still spoken.

We were told that out of the tens of millions of Spanish speakers in the United States, only a fraction of a percent were from Spain so for most of our purposes of learning Spanish it would be better not to use it in our speech or writing.  We also did not learn distinción.

In my experience the teacher may impart some of his or her dialect.  My teachers were Colombian and even many years later people tell me that words or phrases I use are Colombian.

Anecdotally, it seems that 20 or so years ago and in areas without many Spanish speakers, peninsular Spanish was taught.

&gt;Traditionally foreign language learners of Spanish were taught that the informal ‘you’ forms are used when ‘one is on first-name terms’ (Butt and Benjamin 1988: 126). This leads to the generalisation of such situations as: when addressing friends, family members, children, animals and God (Butt and Benjamin 1988). However, Butt and Benjamin do warn that one should be careful of over-generalisations, and Batchelor and Pountain (1992) indicate some important additions which would nowadays be normal in Spain (but not necessarily in Latin America). These are:  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;– among young people, whatever the circumstances;  
&gt;  
&gt;– among people of different ages in almost any informal situation;  
&gt;  
&gt;– addressing priests;  
&gt;  
&gt;– wherever it is desired to establish a friendly note, even in ‘semiformal’ situations  
&gt;  
&gt;(shops, banks, restaurants, etc.);  
&gt;  
&gt;– in public speeches, especially by politicians to their audiences;  
&gt;  
&gt;– in advertisements when a ‘matey’ tone is required.  
&gt;  
&gt;(Batchelor and Pountain 1992: 283)  
&gt;  
&gt;The deliberate flouting of these expected uses can produce subtle differences. For example, to use usted with someone in one of the ‘semiformal’ situations mentioned above may in fact imply rebuke, irritation, superiority, or a general distancing of the speaker. Equally to use usted with those in an inferior position in hierarchical situations may be a deliberate sign of respect.  
&gt;  
&gt;It must, however, be stressed that those situations described above refer particularly to Spain. One important phenomenon of post-Franco Spain has been the increased use of the informal forms. During the later Franco years tú and vosotros were increasingly used amongst those opposed to the regime as a form of solidarity and comradeship. Usted was associated with the values of the traditional family of hierarchical Francoist Spain. Once the dictatorship had come to an end the use of tú and vosotros was identified with the opening up of the country, with freedom in public life and with change in general. This has had a major impact on peninsular Spanish, and can be observed to differing degrees throughout the country, to some extent depending on the political colour of the region.",0,1558395346,FALSE,t3_bqzt4q,TRUE,t3_bqzt4q,/r/Spanish/comments/bqzt4q/tú_vs_usted_yet_again/eo9n1lk/,1,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE

I volunteer --- yeah, a bit surprising since you've helped me by answering my questions on here and know my level of Spanish --- as an ""assistant"" teacher at a ""Spanish Language Experience"" for seniors at the community center.

The teacher is a native speaker. So she definitely knows the language. Let me make it clear that she can speak Spanish while I cannot. But it's probably been 50 years since she studied Spanish grammar. While I'm in the middle of studying Spanish grammar. So sometimes I correct her or can explain the grammar. 

I remember getting into an argument with the teacher over the sentence ""I like carrots."" She fell into the English trap of thinking that the subject was ""I."" And I had a time convincing her that in Spanish the subject was ""carrots"" so the verb had to be plural, ""Me gustan las zanahorias.""

I can also explain things from the point of view of an English speaker trying to learn Spanish. So things she just takes for granted like padres meaning parents, I can highlight and explain. And I can explain how to say something to an English tongue.

wheresthecorn,learner,"Although we translate gustar as *to like*, in reality, it functions more like *to please.*So, when you're saying *Me gusta la manzana* you're really saying something more like *The apple pleases me* or *The apple is pleasing to me*. Obviously no sane person would ever say this, but it is essentially how the verb functions.

That being said, the pronoun *te* in this context is an indirect object pronoun (IOP), which is another way of saying *to you* or to perform an action toward you, unto you, etc; it shows direction toward *you*. So when you say *Te gusta la manzana*, you're theoretically saying *The apple pleases you* or *The apple is pleasing* ***to*** ***you***, but more realistically, *You like the apple*.

Now, the *va* part just adds another layer to this. In your example, *va* is referring to the thing that is going to please you, for example *Te va a gustar la manzana -- va* being associated with *la manzana*.

The reason why *lo vas a gustar* doesn't work is because *gustar*, when talking about liking things, always has to include a indirect object pronoun (me, te, le, nos, os, les). *Lo* is a direct object pronoun (DOP), which essentially replaces ""it"" or ""the thing"" and doesn't show direction toward someone or something (such as *to you, to him, to her,* etc.) To my knowledge, you almost always need an IOP when using *gustar* in this sense.

However, you can use *gustas* or *vas a gustar* when you're talking about if someone likes you. For example, *Piensas que le gustas?* or, *Do you think that she likes you?* or, more technically, *Do you think that you are pleasing to her?* (Quick note: using *gustar* when talking about liking people *may* be perceived in a romantic and/or sexual way. If you're talking about getting along with others, use *caerse bien* or *llevarse bien*.)

I hope I explained this somewhat well. *Gustar*, along with other verbs like *interesar, importar,* and *extrañar* can be pretty difficult to understand at first since they function almost backwards compared to English.

wheresthecorn,learner,"Just like someone else said, reading will improve your vocab among other things, but, IMO, it won't help you that much (if at all) when it comes to physically speaking.

I like to think of it like an athlete or a musician. A football star can watch tapes and study other teams' plays, but if he steps on the field without actually doing them first, he's probably gonna struggle since he hasn't prepared beforehand. Same for a musician: a violinist can listen to as many concertos as possible and get inspiration, ideas, etc., but *thinking* you can do it is far different than actually *doing it*.

You can read and form ideas and create hypothetical conversations in your head with your newfound vocab (I'm guilty of this myself), but one part of achieving fluency in regards to speaking is spontaneity of response. Speaking is a matter of combining your physical and mental skills -- I'd go so far as to say that speaking is in some way muscle memory. By practicing speaking, you're connecting your mind to your mouth.  


And a forewarning: speaking is incredibly difficult and you will get frustrated. What's most important is that you remain confident and don't give up. When it comes to foreign language, either use it or lose it.  


Edit: Speaking with natives is perhaps the best possible thing you can do to improve. Find someone patient and willing to help.

Realistically its probably doable if you can put in 10-20 hrs a week (depending on your intelligence/ability etc). I guess that assumes that I'm average. Maybe I'm good at languages and my 10-15/wk routine isn't feasible for all but I don't think that's the case here.

Specific response to you - your plan is good. Get a kindle or kindle app so you can read with the built in translator &amp; dictionary. It's slow at first but the best way to get yourself ""thinking"" in spanish and bring all that stuff you studied into something useful. Find podcasts at speeds that you can follow. It should be slightly difficult but you should be able to know the gist of what theyre saying. Don't try to catch every word. Once you're catching almost every word, find something harder[1]. Netflix is great for shows but you might find it too hard at first compared to learner-oriented podcasts. Youtube has tons of learner-oriented resources as well. 

And yea have a regular speaking practice partner. Some local resource if you have some or paid via a website like italki.com. It's important to have longer dedicated conversations and not just ordering food or groceries and trying to chit chat (it's not their job anyway). That said - there's research that shows speaking isn't as important as we think and the bulk of your study should be *comprehensible input*. Listening/reading things that you *mostly* understand. It's still fun to have regular speaking practice though and serves as a good way to feel like youre making progress. Point being I wouldnt spend $$$ on many hours of tutors per week unless you want the tutor to be actually *directing* your study plan too.

The wiki here has tons of podcasts/books links but you'll have to dig yourself to find what works for you.

[1]as for listening there's also some ideas that you should start listening to native speech right away, and simply pause &amp; repeat more and more until you understand what is said and practice that way. Link(https://itsnachotime.com/fast-spanish/ - a lot of learners really like his methods and he's from Spain so you might find his content helpful). This as opposed to listening to podcasts where they speak at unrealistically slow pace. I think that *would* work well but requires sit down study time.

IAMA_Saguaro_AMA,heritage (colombia),"Eh... maybe. The issue is, too many Latin classes totally skip or minimize the spoken aspect of the language (for obvious reasons) but with Spanish, being a living language, that can't or shouldn't happen. Being able to speak and comprehend the spoken language is a major component of learning the language and gaining fluency.

But, you've got a good basis for learning things like verb paradigms, though modern Romance languages have veered off from the way classical Latin used some tenses and moods. If you've studied a lot of medieval Latin, though, it'll be a little more straighfoward. You'll also notice patterns from the sound changes that occurred as VL split into the different Romance languages (rex&gt; rey, roy, roi, rei, re etc.).

Like, Spanish -ar verbs behave similar to Latin first declension verbs. It should be noted that at some point in Vulgar Latin, the classical 4-conjugation verbal system essentially collapsed into a system of -ar, -ir, and -er verbs in Romance languages (but -ere, -ire, and -re in French).


Prsn | Spn | Spn | Lat | Lat
----|---|---|---|---
1st | -o | -amos | -ō | -āmus
2nd | -as | -áis | -ās | -tatis
3rd | -a | -an | -at | -ant


There's also a two gender system, instead of three. The neuter gender largely was absorbed by the masculine. You'll find traces of the neuter gender, but even when it's used (like the article ""lo"") adjetives are still used in the masculine: lo bello, lo feo (the pretty, the ugly) etc.

There's also no plural cases; you just add an -s or -es to nouns to create the plural. Rey (rex), reyes; ley (lex), leyes. And, there's no genitive either, with possession being marked with the preposition *de* (la casa de Maria = Maria's house) or with a possessive adjetive or pronoun (tu casa / la casa tuya = your house)


Anywho, the approach used in Lingua Latina is based on modern language learning, so whereas LLPSI is kind of rare in its approach for Latin, most Spanish resources use the same/similar approach. As a bonus, you can find a native speaker wiling to help or practice with you, something that's impossible to do with Latin, not to mention all of the shows and movies on Netflix, Prime, etc. And at a certain point, you'll be able to read children's books in Spanish, something that doesn't really exist in Latin.",0,1565205758,FALSE,t3_cn8wbp,TRUE,t3_cn8wbp,/r/Spanish/comments/cn8wbp/learning_from_a_latin_students_perspective/ew891i8/,1,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE

ShadowRukario,l2,"Hello!

Non native speaker here, but I work in an American hospital with a large community of people who speak Spanish among other languages.

The general consensus from not only our policy but other native speakers is to use the formal version when speaking to patients or visitors. Some of our staff don't know enough Spanish to differentiate between formal or informal but 99% of patients are more appreciative of being able to communicate comfortably in their native tongue. So even informal Spanish is preferred to no Spanish at all. No reasonable person will become enraged if you accidentally refer to them as tú. If it's bothersome they'll likely just correct you politely.

That being said, if you are able to fluently communicate in Spanish, the formal version is preferred regardless of your age difference (small children and babies as an exception). Some people may respond informally but we are encouraged to continue speaking formally. That's because we're considered to be in a professional seeing. This is similar to how waiters or other customer service personnel will always (usually) refer to you as sir or ma'am. Depending on your clientele and region, you may be able to speak more informally with patients and visitors. Similar to how southern American English is considered more informal than northern American English. Language is very region dependent.

My region doesn't really use vosotros so I can't speak on your experience there.

TL;DR If you aren't sure of a future situation where you would use usted or tú, ask yourself if you would use sir or ma'am talking to this person in English.",4,1564019291,FALSE,t3_chgs8k,FALSE,t3_chgs8k,/r/Spanish/comments/chgs8k/for_native_spanish_speakers_at_a_drs/eut3ufc/,15,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE

FireZeLazer,a1,"I don't understand the hate for it, personally I learned a ton of Spanish from it.

I learned Spanish in school for 5 years and did okay (got an A) but in reality I could not have a conversation in Spanish at all and could barely read and write. All it taught me was to recognise words. 

I then went for several years without doing any Spanish and essentially forgot all but the basics. 

After a holiday to Tenerife, it re-inspired me to learn Spanish. I grabbed a Spanish dictionary and phrasebook and improved fast as a lot of old knowledge came back. My Spanish still sucked though. 

Once I got back to England I started using Duolingo and it helped a lot. I used it on and off for about 6 months and then stopped. Then stopped for about a year. Then again for a couple months before going to Menorca. My Spanish was far better than it was in Tenerife although I lacked confidence. I could speak basic Spanish and order things in restaurants, shops, and have basic conversations. The main limitation is that I could not understand the spoken Spanish of the other person. I feel like that's something that only improved by watching shows or speaking regularly with people in Spanish. I then stopped again for a year and recently started again 2 months ago, and am currently on a 60 day streak. My Spanish has improved a lot again and I can read and write fairly well. Speaking is okay, a basic enough level that I can communicate effectively in Spanish. The main issue again is understanding spoken Spanish is still very difficult. 

So overall aside from 5 years at school I've pretty much learned all my Spanish from Duolingo and I feel I've learned a lot. Your reading and writing definitely improves more than speaking/listening so I'd recommend finding something else. I feel like if I were to live in Spain for a couple months it would help a ton as I already know many words/verbs/etc, it's mainly just working on the fluidity, vocab, and understanding of spoken Spanish.",3,1565146362,FALSE,t3_cm0f3s,TRUE,t3_cm0f3s,/r/Spanish/comments/cm0f3s/is_duolingo_any_good/ew5vrq4/,1,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE

Charliegip,estadounidense entre b2 y c1," I doubt anyone would find the early stages of duolingo hard considering it is set up more like a game than a learning device. I wouldn't recommend duolingo to anyone to actually learn a language, at least before learning the basics. In my opinion duolingo is useful to learn vocab but not much else. OP in my opinion you need to start off teaching yourself or reviewing verb conjugations, start off at present, then go on to learn words through either looking them up or with the assistance of memrise or duolingo then move on to the other tenses such as the imperfect, preterite, future, etc. Basically what I would do is start having conversations in Spanish with yourself and think about how to say certain things. If you dont know how you would say something then look it up and figure it out. If you're having a convo in English, after the convo is done, try thinking about how it would have played out in Spanish then look up words accordingly. Do this with signs, billboards, and anything else to teach yourself new words and phrases. If you are looking for books try manual de gramática, 1001 Spanish verbs, and other books like that to teach yourself words and constructs. Manual de gramática is what university Spanish teachers use to teach the language. You can also look up books such as [Gente: nivel basico](https://www.amazon.com/Gente-básico-María-José-Fuente/dp/020520919X) which is another book that they use in beginner Spanish at universities. Good luck!

Charliegip,estadounidense entre b2 y c1,"Coming from someone who lives near a place (New Orleans) with lots of tourists and people trying to sell things and get a quick buck, the reason people ignore these people is because they are either just annoyed/tired of them or sometimes acknowledging these people can  make them pester you more. When I went to Spain and Paris over the summer there were many street vendors trying to sell things, or con artists trying to make a buck. I addressed these people at first but quickly went to just ignoring them because that seemed the best policy. In Paris, I mostly just started speaking Spanish and they would get frustrated because they would try to talk to me in English or French and they weren't getting anywhere with me. While I say this it's also important to keep in mind your basic humanity. If someone seems sincere then maybe give them a buck if you have it or, say, acknowledge them as to not be rude, but if someone seems like they are just trying to cheat you I'd be inclined to just ignore them. 

Some helpful things to say when rejecting someone might be 

""Lo siento, es que no tengo dinero."" ""I'm sorry, but I just don't have money."" This one can be tricky especially if you are in a market and they follow you around only to see you buy a burger or another thing. 

""Lo siento, pero no me interesa."" ""I am sorry, but I am not interested."" 

Tbh though, the best thing might to just be to ignore the vast majority of these people. Letting them think/know that you speak Spanish, or just that you are a nice person might make them think about continuing after you. 

The most important thing is use your judgement and instincts about a situation or a person.

Books: Any kids books. Once you get more advanced the Harry Potter series is good. You might also try reading a book you've already read again in Spanish. Knowing the story and having a general idea of what happens will help you follow the book. 

TV shows: Any kids shows, Pocoyo is pretty good. [Extra en Español](https://youtu.be/Dfb9-ZTCA-E) is also good to learn Spanish (if you need subtitles look around YouTube and you should be able to find copies with subs in English and Spanish).

Tips: Speak and use what you learn everyday even if you just talk to yourself. That is the most important tip anyone can give you. One thing I did that really helped me was replay conversations I had had previously, in English, in my head in Spanish. I wanted to see how that convo would have played out in Spanish. You can also try translating any roadsigns, billboards, or advertisements into Spanish to try and teach yourself new words. The second most important thing is to always be curious and to never stop looking up new words and phrases. If you want to learn Spanish, or any language for that matter, you need to commit completely to learning it, use it everyday and learn something new everyday. Read stuff on the internet and this subreddit, switch your phone into Spanish, subscribe to Spanish YouTube channels, listen to Spanish music, look at memes in Spanish on Instagram and Facebook, just do anything to keep Spanish on and in your mind. In my opinion, if you really want to learn and become fluent you need to change your lifestyle and try to immerse yourself in the language the best you can no matter where you live. Good luck!

At my university, and I believe at most universities/community college, the teachers are required to speak Spanish and only speak English rarely whenever a subject **must** be clarified.  It is a different beast all together than high school spanish. In High school Spanish you learn Spanish through English but in higher education you learn Spanish by being dropped into it and talked through it with hand gestures and sometimes instructions that are in English.

OP to address your question, I have serious doubts about you being able to completely test out of Spanish from the CLEP if you do not already have a pretty good experience with it. I took the CLEP about 2 years ago, before transferring to my university. I was not completely fluent in the language, but I was probably at a B1 level, which is intermediate. To give you an idea of what that means, I would frequently spend hours in my Spanish teachers office just talking and shooting the shit with him in Spanish, I also would speak frequently to my girlfriend's parents who hardly speak English.  The written part of the CLEP was easy, if you want to see practice question for the CLEP they can be found at [this link](https://clep.collegeboard.org/pdf/spanish-language-fact-sheet.pdf). They have practice tests that you can buy from their website for like $20, but the part that got me at the time was the listening part. You can find practice listening questions [at this link](https://clep.collegeboard.org/world-languages/spanish-language/sample-questions/4).

What I did to prepare was I used doulingo as a supplement. It can teach you some vocabulary but that on it's own is by far not enough to teach you the language. I turned a lot of my social media accounts to Spanish, and began to read basic Spanish texts online, and stuff I could find on Spanish facebook pages, and here on this subreddit, I also began to replay some of the conversations I would have throughout the day in my head and then think about how I might have that same conversation in Spanish and if I didn't know some words, I would look them up. I also would translate signs and billboards I saw from English to Spanish. Another thing that was a tremendous help for me was that I worked at the mall in my old home town and there we got a lot of people from Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Mexico coming in, and I would help them in Spanish and also talk to one of my coworkers, who was from Puerto Rico in Spanish. So if you have a job currently and Spanish speakers come in I would try to attempt to help them in Spanish. If you want to learn enough to pass the CLEP it wil not be easy. My teacher at my community college told me personally, he had never seen a person who was not a native speaker or who didn't have a relatively good grasp of the language go into the CLEP and get all of the credits available. Those tests are meant to see if you already have basically mastered everything you need to learn from basic Spanish college level classes, so you will need a relatively good vocabulary and a good knowledge, of the present, imperfect, preterit, future, and a little exposure to the present subjunctive, conditional tenses and possibly command forms as well(which are just the same as the present subjunctive in all cases but tú commands.) It is not impossible, but you will definitely need to work hard and know your shit. If it were easy then everyone would do it to skip beginner Spanish. Now because you don't seem to mind only passing up Spanish 1 and 2 it might not be too difficult, but still you are going to need to study pretty hard and do more than just doulingo. Good luck!

You shouldn't try to go anywhere in a city, or country in this case, you are unfamiliar with without adult supervision if you are a minor and great precaution if you are an adult.

Charliegip,ee.uu. entre b2 y c1,"So yeah there are actually a bunch of different ways to pronounce LL there is the /ʎ/ which appears in words such as Austra**li**a there is also /ʝ/ which is the ""traditional"" LL pronunciation. The one they teach you in High school that sounds like the y in ""yam"". There is /ʒ/ which appears in the English word ""vision"" written phonetically as /viʒən/ or like the second g in ""garage"". There is also an up and coming pronunciation from Argentina that sounds like /ʃ/ or the English ""sh"". 

Your observation of the ""th"" sound in sed is a very good observation and it is something called a [fricativa](http://www.livingspanish.com/consonantes-fricativas.htm) in Spanish linguistics. It also occurs with a lot of words ending in ""-ado""

Again your observation with ""naranja"" is well founded. I saw that someone was saying that the ""j"" in Spanish is always pronounced like ""h"" in English and this is very far from the truth. A lot of people around the world associate it more with the letter ""k"" with a soft h trill at the end. Furthermore you can never say that any sound is always produced the same that kind of generalization can stick you with bad habits later on in learning a language. As far as your observation goes it's something that occurs with some dialects of Spanish. It's called [velarization in English and velarización in Spanish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velarization) this can happen on the last ""n"" in naranja, but it typically happens with N's either before consonants other than velar stops, before vowel-beginning words, or before a pause. So sometimes this can make the word ""pan"" sound like ""pang"". Long story short with what you are hearing it's just the combination of the N and the J together that changes the sound of the N slightly. 

These are all great observations and they are good things to note when trying to pick up a Spanish accent.

""¿Por qué fuiste al dentista?"" = ""For what reason/why did you go to the dentist?""

confusedchild02,b2 siele,"**TLDR at the bottom.**

It looks like nothing has changed. He has lied about and been scammy about so many things that I actually gave up trying to keep up. 

He has lied about account information being deleted after people cancelling accounts. Last year I had one of their employees still check to see if my information was still in their system and it was.

He has lied about gaining **26 pounds of muscle** in a month. Yes, you read that correctly. Apparently he overcame the limitations of science. 

He has lied about all of his tutors having degrees in teaching both English and Spanish. 

He has lied about reaching B1 in Spanish in a month. 

He has lied about donating 1% of what customers paid to charity for people in Venezuela who are in need. (Newsflash to him: The only people left in Venezuela are the ones who either 1) can't escape or 2) are rich in Venezuela and would be poor if they left because of currency problems.)

He has made (what I assume) to be a joke about language learners sounding like ""a retarded 8-year-old"" on a guide to advertise his service. 

The last time that I got any updates was last summer, and during that time an **employee who worked full time** (6 days a week, 8 hours a day) **received about $15-20**USD **but in Venezuela's currency**. And if you know anything about Venezuela's currency, [it's so worthless](https://dolartoday.com/) that some people have made arts and crafts from it (like origami, etc). 

Back in 2016 I was the first person to ever make a review on their company and because I didn't have only positive things to say, they started paying people to make more ""non-sponsored"" reviews in order to knock my review down on the results page of Google etc. (Mine is still on the first page if you google ""BaseLang review"" though.)  

I really loved BaseLang at first. Over time I started to feel weird. I had to gain trust of the tutors for them to even tell me what was going on. I'm not sure if things have changed but during that time they were forbidden to talk about the situation in Venezuela... (I kept asking how it was possible for me to get what was, at the time, unlimited lessons for 99USD a month.) I just kept asking questions about Venezuela and every time they would get weird. Eventually I just asked one of them ""Why do y'all always try to change the subject when I ask that question but are so chatty when I talk about anything else?""  

I saw some tutors get really stressed out. After a while there began to be a really high turnover which Connor always blamed on... whatever the excuse was at the time. 

Eventually it got to the point where I had a tutor cry on the chat. Our session had been interrupted by the electricity. She just got so frustrated, cried a little bit, then she apologized to me... Call me a softy but it was that moment I knew I needed to move around. Man, I have so many recollections. 

Even though the tutors understood my financial situation (at the time BaseLang + side tutoring where I paid them via PayPal was the only way I could afford tutoring) and they told me not to feel guilty about it, I still felt a little guilty. 

I still kind of smile and laugh at the memories of them gaining my trust and spending so many lessons just roasting the dude and being able to vent about it with me. The last time Connor replied to me on one of his Reddit accounts was on [a comment I made on here last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnspanish/comments/7nuprz/baselang_sale_99month_save_30_for_new_customers/ds4xie2/) and one of the employees said they had a meeting about it LOL. They were like ""Whoever it is must have some inside knowledge!"" and I was like ""Oh, I wrote that. That's my Reddit username."" They loved it. 🤣🤣🤣

For a lot of them, the company is their only/best option, so to have a student they enjoy being around is like a refuge or a nice distraction for a short time, so I don't blame people who still use the service or who are simply unaware.

If you want to speak well, you have to practice speaking, a lot. There's no magic bullet for it but there's also no reason to fret. It's ok to suck. You goal is to speak with confidence and you can do that if you put in the time practicing. The only direction you can go is up if you don't stop practicing. My advice, grab that conversation partner and go back to practicing, but this time, make it a real 50/50 conversation with you speaking half of the time. It's probable that the conversation might be ""dumbed down"" from when it was just her speaking, but that's ok, you have to start somewhere.

I recommend trying some podcasts for total beginners. I think Coffee Break Spanish is good for that, but there's probably some other ones too.

It's also boring, and I haven't done it, but it might be a good plan to look up a frequency dictionary and memorize a few words (especially verbs, nouns, and adjectives) a day starting from the most frequent. I learned Spanish in school so I memorized lots of these words just by reading the vocabulary for each chapter (for example, the first chapter of my first textbook contained a list of about 20 common verbs, and memorizing those was extremely helpful) but it seems like you'll need to get the words somehow.

All that said, I've read a couple posts by actual Spanish educators that argue for a more immersion-based approach (including lots of in-class conversation, etc.) vs. one based on learning concepts and memorizing vocab.

BlissteredFeat,c2 or thereabouts,"I'm late to the conversation, but this is a very interesting thread.  I'm a non-native speaker of Spanish and I teach Spanish (as a portion of my instructor load).  I think I speak well and work hard on my accent, but even so I would say I have an identifiable English/American accent.  But it has never been a problem.  When I lived in Mexico my accent was better, and when I visit I can hear myself improve, but I do the best I can.  

Two things: 

1) I became less concerned about accent after traveling in Spain, where there is a wide variety of accents, and none of them sound like a Mexican accent.  If you travel from say Barcelona to Cáceres, the accent and speed of the language change so much, as a foreigner I am amazed they are the same language.  This is funny: when I'm in Mexico people can identify me as American; when I'm in Spain I am often asked if I'm Mexican or an American living in Mexico. So much about accent is relative.

2) Here are some things to be aware of and change as an English speaker:

\-shorten the s sound.  In English the s is very long, in Spanish it's short.  This is especially true at the end of words. As the English speaker draws out the s, the vowel before it is also likely to be elongated.  Work on shortening the s and other sounds will fall into place with practice.

\- the t should not have a lot of air behind it.  In English we put a lot of air into the t sound, especially at the beginning of a word; in Spanish it is unvoiced and subtle. It's nearly an unvoiced English d at the beginning of a word.  In the middle of a word, however, the t is much lighter and faster than in English.  

\-make vowels not only crisp and accurate (as mentioned many times above), but also short.  English has many long vowel sounds.  Spanish does not.  With a simple word like ""gato"" there are two simple short, perfect sounds: ga to.  Both short in duration.  An English speaker is likely to say gaaahtoe.  There is a distinct difference.

\-b/v was covered above as well as d.

\-The other thing is cadence.  While accent is important, the cadence or natural rhythms and inflection (rise and fall) of speaking are also important.  English has a lot of rise and fall in pronunciation and drawn out sounds; Spanish not so much.  Spanish also uses a lot of allision, that is sounds of words joining together; work on getting the overall rhythm and inflection closer to the Spanish you hear, and your Spanish will begin to improve, and accent as the ""only thing"" may matter a little bit less.

That said, I've learned some things about learning languages since then (though I'm still only fluent in English and have been learning Spanish for less than 4 months at this point).

1. There are different things to learn about a language. Some help you pass a test, some help you accomplish a task (like asking where the bathroom is). Some help you understand the sounds. And some help you comprehend. Recognize the difference.
2. If it means nothing to you to learn it, then you probably won't. Find a reason to want (or need) to understand the language and the importance of that reason will accelerate your understanding of the language. It seems dumb to say, but our brain will actually prioritize the information associated with a language if it understands a good reason to know it. 
3. Multiple methods of getting/using information about the language is the best way to ensure comprehension. Don't expect to do flashcards and suddenly remember how to use.
4. Don't expect to be talking fluently quickly. It's a process. It took you years before you could read a book in your native tongue from the time you started learning to speak. You've already got the basics so it should go faster depending on your exposure to the language, but there's a reason that you can take 4 years of the classes and still be far from fluent - there's a lot to learn and you likely aren't using the language 24/7 like you were with your native tongue.",0,1566866963,FALSE,t3_cvwu34,TRUE,t3_cvwu34,/r/learnspanish/comments/cvwu34/currently_taking_spanish/ey6yg6d/,3,learnspanish,t5_2rd6d,TRUE,TRUE

LogicalDissonance,learner,"In my high school Spanish class, this approach was used. However, this was at a higher level than an introductory course. The intro class started in English. Stuff like ""This is a phrase, can you repeat it?"" Once a few verbs were introduced along with vocab, instructions began to include more Spanish until it was *all* in Spanish. (Unless you had a question.) 

Eventually, they 'banned' us from using '¿Cómo se dice?'. That rule made me more anxious and made it feel like I was drowning. Yes, forcing me to explain in my broken Spanish somewhat improves it, but it feels really bad in front of 20 other people and doesn't make me want to continue learning. In my experience, banning the use of questions in English (no matter how unproductive they are for learning) makes students frustrated and disillusioned really quickly. 

Complete instructions in Spanish (for whatever reason a new language sounds really fast) were often impossible to follow without follow-up questions. I'd catch a verb or cognate but miss the whole meaning. Speaking up in class becomes dependent on knowing how to form the question and if you don't, it's just easier not to ask. That doesn't seem to improve anything.   
I find it hard to switch languages because of all of this. After class, I'd get stuck, (that might just be a me thing) and I'd have this out of body feeling that I 'wasn't allowed' to speak in English.

I think it comes down to being flexible on both sides. The student needs to feel comfortable enough to move out of their comfort zone, and the teacher hopefully doesn't force them out before they're ready. 

Just my two cents.

I'd say you've covered everything there to be honest! 

Jokes aside, I'd say a good approach is this (at least, this is what I was doing when I felt my biggest jump up during B2):

- Reading authentic stuff is the biggest thing. Read books in Spanish (shorter books if you want to be cautious) - at B2 you could probably try Spanish/Latin American literature, rather than translated stuff (like Harry Potter etc). News is also a really good source of vocabulary - El País is my go-to, but most of that is European news so maybe a Mexican or Latin American outlet would be good for you. Also I've never found those dual-readers (with the English text on the opposite page) useful, and at B2 you shouldn't be using those anyway - just in case someone tells you to!

- get a comprehensive (advanced) grammar book with exercises - this really is where I saw the biggest difference, and where my speaking etc (when using the grammar I'd learned in conversations) started to go beyond that of some of my intermediate friends. Edelsa have a pair of books (Diccionario Práctico de Gramática, and the accompanying Libro de Ejercicios) but that is a lot of content, so it depends how much time you have! I used Collins Advanced Spanish Grammar (UK) which is written in English, but has some good practice exercises and explanations.

- probably repeating what you've already heard here, but Netflix etc - any Spanish TV/film is worth using for practice. Spain has a Netflix studio now so there's a lot of good stuff coming out - lots of people recommend La Casa de Papel (heist series), Alta Mar (a whodunnit murder mystery at sea), El Ministerio del Tiempo (never seen it but heard it's good). Narcos is alright but it changes too often between English and Spanish and I don't like the mix, nor the actual show for that matter. 

Famous Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar has lots of good films - La Piel Que Habito is a personal favourite.

That said, most of the things I've recommended there are Spanish Spanish. A good Mexican series is Luis Miguel (about a cheesy Mexican singer from 80s/90s).
If your listening isn't great, I love watching Disney films in Spanish (they usually have a Spanish Spanish dub *and* a Latin American one) as they speak a bit more slowly and clearly.",0,1564070180,FALSE,t3_chbqki,FALSE,t1_euvme1q,/r/learnspanish/comments/chbqki/fluent_in_5_months_some_personal_tips/euw4jqn/,4,learnspanish,t5_2rd6d,TRUE,TRUE

- I'm not sure about the parental note but it would shock me if that was required. Curious for others to chime in. Aside from any additional stuff you need as a minor though, if you're a US citizen you just need a passport. If you're from another country, check the Visa travel requirements, you might need one.

- Same things you'd bring on any trip I suppose: daily clothing and toiletries, electronics (hopefully none besides your phone), and any other fun stuff. Pack a strong sun screen and cool clothes! The only thing I can see you having trouble with is weird stuff like non-native plants and foods. I was able to bring through a ton of American candy with no issue (for my friend not me)

- I found the people to be quite nice. I stayed with my friend most of the time but if you're an outgoing guy/gal you can probably easily get into conversations with locals. Again this will depend on where you go exactly. It'll be a bit harder since you're underage

- This probably depends on the exactly location more than any other answer, but my perception is that it is safer than many Americans think. I stayed around Saltillo and Mazunte (for 2 weeks) and never ran into any trouble. I'm not an overly cautious stay-in-the-tourist-areas kind of guy either. I *suspect* that most of the crime is between cartels or other crime organizations and wouldn't involve a bystander.

- I didn't encounter any judgment for my shitty Spanish. In fact most people were delighted to see a foreigner (the places I stayed were not tourist-y areas) and asked about where I was from. People seemed to appreciate my attempts at Spanish, and encouraged me to try even when I got self-conscious. Looking different? I doubt it. At worst you'll get pegged as a gringo and might get hustled harder but I never got any sense of that kind of judgment there.

El Souvenir: It's a group of friends that casually discuss travel. Can be a bit hard to hear the enunciation sometimes. Feels like a few friends chatting in a room rather than a ""program"" per se.

Duolingo Podcast: I hesitated to include this one since it has a lot of english in it, but damn, the content is actually really good for a language learning podcast. It's almost like a watered down version of...

Radio Ambulante: An all-Spanish NPR program that tells various stories about Latin American culture. The Spanish isn't /slow/ by any means, but it's enunciated in a ""radio voice"" kind of way. 

Hablemos Espanol: The podcast of one Mexican guy who talks about various things. The content is usually very Mexico-focused and contains a lot of Mexican-specific slang. 

La Vida En Espanol: Good quality content, though I don't personally find the stories to be very exciting. Could be my lack of comprehension

Historias Perdidas: My current fav. It's a single dude who narrates a short story about some intriguing event or story (stuff like Atlantis, Jack The Ripper, Noah's Ark, The Romanov Dynasty, Escape from Alcatraz, etc). He has a great radio voice, annunciates clearly, and uses just enough advanced vocab that I find myself learning from it rather than being intimidated.",,1564001372,FALSE,t3_ch9gu6,FALSE,t1_eurryw4,/r/Spanish/comments/ch9gu6/my_school_changed_the_way_spanish_is_taught_and_i/eus06ib/,5,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE
ASunCame,a2,"Just realized I'm not exactly sure that ""independent clause"" was the right term but it was kinda confusing anyway so I'll explain it a bit clearer: 

In English, 'in order to' (also remember that English allows this to be shortened to just 'to') can be followed by a verb to speak generally about what has to happen for that verb to occur. E.g. ""In order to bake"", ""In order to be a teacher"", ""In order to pass"", etc. All of these would most closely be translated just to 'para + verbo' in Spanish. 

Sometimes we want to talk about the requirements not just to do some verb, but for a particular subject to do some verb. In English the most natural way to express this is something like: ""In order for him to succeed, we need to push him harder"". In Spanish this kind of construction doesn't really exist (I think), instead it uses a construction more similar to: ""In order that he succeed, we need to push him harder"". So now, instead of 'in order to' modifying a verb, it can modify any sentence: In order that my cat get enough nutrition, In order that the package arrive intact, etc. This carries more information than the more general ""in order to get enough nutrition"" which is just the verb. These cases would all be translated as 'para que'. Note that the verb following 'para que' should be in the subjunctive (interestingly, the subjunctive sounds better in English too: in order that you ~~are~~ be quiet )

Note, I'm not a native speaker! Please take this post with a grain of salt, and native speakers please jump in and correct me if I've erred!

This is no different to the use of ‘within’ in English plays. There is a door, and from within - i.e., on a theatrical level, behind the door - a voice comes out.

I'm happy to help with anything you want over pm, if you don't feel right about posting them here; but as has been said, you can just do that.

 I would ask though that, with all due respect, you at least make sure that your questions have a bit more depth to them. I don't believe that you couldn't have worked out the use of dentro here with a little bit of thought - if the dentro los siguientes versos, you'll be well aware that variation with the use of multiple prepositions, especially *de*, is diachronically widespread in Spanish (hence all the various synchronically monomorphemic prepositions - or they have, if you prefer, cranberry morphemes - that are etymologically polymorphemic: derredor, alrededor, and of course dentro itself, and similarly donde, etc.), and even in modern Spanish that variation in many cases remains (*tras la puerta/detrás la puerta/detrás de la puerta/tras de ti*), while here it's contextually hard to see what else it could mean; if as a stage direction, well, it's exactly the same as the English usage, and pretty readily comprehensible in the context - and the *caja* you could simply have looked up in a dictionary or on google. 

This is a sub, and I'm here, to help with questions about Spanish, but asking us to take a few seconds out of our day purely to spare you a few seconds thinking or looking something up doesn't seem particularly respectful of people's time to me.

SalterEA,learner ( usa ),"I'm a novice. I'm often overwhelmed, and prone to zoning out, while watching **TV shows** with subtitles at normal speed. I wasn't able to process what I was reading and/or hearing fast enough. At some point, I searched for, found, and acclimated to a web browser addon for controlling **playback speed**.

At **20%** playback speed, I have the **audio muted** because it is too slow. The video lends incredible context as I process the subtitles. It's also slow enough that I can often lookup a word on SpanishDict on another monitor before that chunk of text (if not, at least, the next) has played itself through.

I don't have to rewind to keep up and it's not so slow that I have an unnerving desire to speed it up.

I intend to **progress as follows**:

* **Increase the playback speed**.
* Unmute the audio, when the playback speed has gradually increased enough.
* Switch from **primarily reading** rewatched shows to **primarily listening**.
* Increase the playback speed **faster than 100%** to sharpen real time reading of subtitles.
* Switch from primarily speed reading rewatched shows to primarily listening at accelerated playback speeds.

... *may need more studying and content resources to bridge any gap(s) here.*

* Practice listening to less professionally edited / scripted YouTube content of known topics and/or context.
* Practice listening to live news content for a more rapidly changing mix of topics and/or context.

My initial focus for literacy and listening comprehension was **short stories** (with available audio) and **music** (with available lyrics). I prefer **TV shows** over the short stories because of how much more richly the video enhances my contextual awareness.

I found **music** to be pleasant to mumble along to but incredibly difficult to process and retain. I also didn't make as large strides in my progression which I owe to the abundance of creative liberties taken with poetic language and being led astray by regional slang and other lyrical tactics which became more its own journey to track down than a support to my self-directed progression toward basic comprehension.

As other users have noted, it sounds as if she isn't a native speaker of Spanish, and I'd say that assessment seems correct. While she has a fluid command of the language, she's not *fluent*--nearly, but not quite. Aside from the pauses during conjugation, here are a few dialectical indications that she didn't grow up speaking Spanish as her primary language and why it may be easier to understand her:

* In Spanish, /r/ is meant to be pronounced using the tip of the tongue tapping against the alveolar ridge (where your palate dips up), almost like a /d/ in English. English has this sound too, just try saying 'Betty Betty'--the /t/ is pronounced in this way. However, in English the /r/ is often pronounced very differently than Spanish, often with a raising of the back of the tongue to touch the pre-velar region. This is one dialectical trait that gives Ocasio away: she sometimes pronounces the /r/ incorrectly, for example, when she says &lt;organizar&gt;. Since this is coming from English, it may have made it easier for you to understand her.

* Although she is of Puerto Rican descent, her accent lacks the traits common to that regional dialect. A PR accent is characterized by a few things, namely dropping &lt;s&gt; at the end of a syllable, pronouncing /r/ as [l] (called lateralization), and occasionally pronouncing the trilled /r/ (or multiple /r/) in the velar region instead of using the tip of the tongue. Ocasio does not seem to use any of these devices, which likely makes her much easier to understand, especially for non-native Spanish speakers.

* In Spanish vowels are short, tense and pure, unlike English vowels (of which there are between 13 and 17, depending on the region). Ocasio speaks with a mix of tense vowels and relaxed vowels, the latter quality likely making it easier for native English speakers to understand. I didn't hear evidence of what's called that 'shwa' vowel ([ə]) which doesn't exist in Spanish, but it was likely there.

* Her speech is slow, and she has what's called a 'glottal stop'. A glottal stop is a sound which occurs in English (and plenty of other languages!) that involves an obstruction of airflow in the glottis and can be demonstrated by saying ""uh-oh"". The break between the two syllables is the glottal stop. In Spanish such a stop does not exist, and sentences are read as if every word were connected. Ocasio demonstrates the glottal stop, likely making it easier for native English speakers to understand individual words.

What I find most interesting about her accent is that it most closely resembles an *Argentinian* accent. This is most clearly seen in her pronunciation of the word &lt;yo&gt;. What she demonstrates here is known as a 'reinforcement' of the /j/ sound (which resembles the sound the &lt;y&gt; makes in 'yea'), changing it to [ʒ] (which resembles the sound the &lt;j&gt; makes in 'Joe'). This is a dialectical character found almost exclusively in Argentina.

I'm not sure if any of this helps you understand why you could understand her better, but hopefully you at least find some of this interesting. If you'd like me to go into detail about anything I've written here, just feel free to ask!

Aside from that usage, a more general rule to follow is that ""para"" indicates direct movement or the transfer of something in some way.

* Lo compré para ti (the bought item is being transferred)
* El tren va para Londres (the train is moving to London)

For ""por"" there are some easy usages you can memorise (through, by, on behalf of, because of). You can use it with an infinitive anytime you want to thank someone for doing something for you (gracias por hablar). And then the general rule to apply outside of these usages is that ""por"" indicates an exchange.

I live in the Midwest. I am Christian and occasionally visit a Spanish speaking church, in which I always speak Spanish (it is the default language in that context, after all). When I go to Mexican restaurants, I typically strike up conversation with the employees in Spanish if they are clearly Spanish speakers (i.e speaking Spanish with other guests or employees) and in both of those settings I have been welcomed with open arms. I do know a handful of foreign students from Spanish-speaking countries and for them it differs. Some welcome that I speak Spanish with them, some are OK with it but don't prefer either, and some actually prefer I do not speak Spanish at all. I think this also has a lot to do with the social surroundings- If I am in a group of English speakers with one Spanish speaker, we speak English. It's rude to only speak Spanish and isolate ourselves from the rest of the group. However if we are one-on-one or in a group of all Spanish speakers, it often is the natural thing to do. When I run into Spanish speakers in everyday life- in stores, etc. I usually don't engage them or if I must, in English (unless it's clear that they speak little English, in which case I help them out by speaking Spanish).",,1550631665,FALSE,t3_asbyfj,FALSE,t3_asbyfj,/r/Spanish/comments/asbyfj/is_it_rude_to_practice_spanish_with_strangers_in/eguoh1g/,4,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE

I should note here that the difference between the prior two is simply between the preterite and the imperfect- the same usages that apply for those two tenses apply here, they just have to be related with the subjunctive imperfect as well.  


\- ""He querido que salgas."" = I have wanted you to leave. Note here that the subjunctive tense isn't past. I have wanted, either over a significant period of time or just recently, you to leave.

Spanish speakers, regardless of intelligence or age, never have to memorize endings; they just pick them up naturally. Thus, learning the endings must be possible somehow, right?

I think the problem is that people are not learning the endings in a practical manner. Looking at conjugation tables over and over again is not going to help; the tables are only useful for looking up forgotten conjugations. Memorizing the conjugations from a list will not help, either.

Instead, people should take one inflection at a time and master it. Use each in a sentence to get a feel for it. Then, move onto the next tense. Eventually, all the inflections will be mastered.",,1550683199,FALSE,t3_asccct,TRUE,t1_egvw8nh,/r/Spanish/comments/asccct/what_makes_spanish_so_difficult_to_learn/egw1a2j/,1,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE
VGM123,intermediate,"No, you're fine.

Let me rephrase my explanation. Sorry, it's hard to explain things that natives use instinctively (and sadly, I am not a native Spanish speaker).

**The preterite is used for completed or ""perfected"" actions--actions that have definite beginnings and ends.** In English, we have three perfect tenses (present, past, and future) that tell us when an action was completed. Spanish has this, too. **In this sense, ""perfect"" means complete.**

**The imperfect is used for incomplete or, well, ""imperfected"" actions--actions that don't have definite beginnings and ends. These can refer to ongoing/repetitive actions or actions that are interrupted by other actions.**

Let's look at some examples of the imperfect and preterite tenses in action.

**The imperfect tense is used for past actions that don't have clear start and end points.**

""Where were you?""

""¿Dónde estabas?""

The time period that you spent somewhere else isn't specified, so you have to use the imperfect. If you want to state where you were at a specific time, then you can use the preterite. In this context, however, the preterite is not necessary.

Here's another example:

""When I was a kid, I played basketball with my friends.""

""Cuando yo era un niño, jugaba al baloncesto con mis amigos.""

Both actions do not require the preterite. It's not as if you were a kid one moment and stopped being a kid the next. The same applies to you playing basketball with your friends. Both are ongoing actions without a specific time frame, so you must use the imperfect.

**The imperfect tense can be used for actions that were interrupted by other actions.**

""We were walking to the school when our mother called us.""

""Caminábamos a la escuela cuando nuestra mamá nos llamó.""

The first verb is imperfect because the action of walking was interrupted by the action of calling. The action of walking was not completed. The second verb is preterite because the action of calling was completed. It had an implied definite beginning and end. It's not as if the mother repeatedly called her kids. She called them once, and that was it.

You can technically use ""estábamos caminando"" (we were walking) instead of ""caminábamos"" (we walked), but the former emphasizes the ongoing nature of the action while the latter doesn't. The first makes the action sound more drawn out as if it took some time. The difference isn't too large, though, and there are times when both tenses are acceptable. Still, the progressive tenses for the present, preterite/imperfect, and future in Spanish aren't used as often as they are in English, so you don't really have to worry so much about the imperfect progressive form.

**The imperfect is also used for actions that occurred repeatedly over time.**

""My mother used to call me on Wednesdays.""

""Mi mamá me llamaba los miércoles.""

Again, this action didn't have a specific timeframe because it was ongoing, so the imperfect is required.

**The preterite is used for actions that had** ***explicit*** **beginnings and ends.**

""I lived in the United States for three years.""

""Viví en los Estados Unidos por tres años.""

This action had a clear start and end. Thus, the preterite is used.

**The preterite can also be used for actions that had** ***implied*** **start and end points.**

""I learned Spanish in high school.""

""Aprendí español en el colegio.""

This action's time frame wasn't specified, but it was implied, meaning that the act of learning Spanish started and ended some time in high school. The action itself is still completed.

**Do note that there are times when you can use either tense, but you'll change the meaning of your sentence when you pick one over the other.**

\---

**TL;DR -- The basic difference is that the preterite has a definite time frame whether it be stated or implied whereas the imperfect does not.**

If you're still confused as to which past tense to use, ask yourself this: ""Does the past action have a clear start point and a clear end point?"" If it does, use the preterite. If it does not, use the imperfect. That's really all there is to it, though there may still be times when the distinction isn't clear. However, most of the time, the distinction is quite clear. You'll get the hang it of it soon enough. ;)

Let's apply this rule of thumb to your question regarding ""'era broma' vs. 'fue un accidente'.""

""Era broma."" ---&gt; If you use the preterite here, you'll be saying that the joke was a joke at one point but stopped being a joke at another point, which is not the meaning you would want to convey. How long the joke is a joke doesn't have a definite beginning and end, so you must use the imperfect.

""Fue un accidente."" ---&gt; If you use the imperfect here, you'll be saying that the accident occurred repeatedly over time or that it was an ongoing action, which is not normally the case. When people talk about accidents, they use a specific time frame, though the time frame may not always be explicit. In other words, they mean that an accident happened at *one* point in time. Thus, the preterite is required.

Does all of this make sense to you? I hope my explanation helped.

The system is overall regular, logical, and intuitive. Even the irregularities have patterns. Yes, that includes the preterite. I've studied the conjugations, and 95% of the time, I can tell how to conjugate a verb by simply looking at it.

Even tossing that argument aside, natives don't even memorize the conjugations; they simply learn them through exposure and context. They don't memorize charts and try to recall the verbs from memory; they just use the verbs spontaneously. Thus, it doesn't seem to take a gifted or intelligent person to master the conjugations.

This even applies to declensions, such as those of German. Again, natives don't memorize all the endings and forms; they simply learn them by listening and repeating.

This seems to be the problem with language courses in general. They don't fully teach you how to speak; they often just teach you what the language is, which you really don't need to know. No one needs to know what all the forms of ""gustar"" are; that can be done by immersion alone.

Moreover, the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) rates Spanish as a ""Category 1 Language,"" which is in the same domain as languages with barely any inflection (e.g. Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, etc.). This means that it only takes 5-6 months on average to attain proficiency, so if you can't master the conjugations in that amount of time, then you are most likely doing something wrong.

Of course, my experience isn't absolute, but I've yet to see a reason to believe that the Spanish verb conjugations (or any forms of morphology, really) are difficult. Is it that they're truly difficult or that people are just not learning them effectively?",,1555202579,FALSE,t3_bcum80,FALSE,t1_ektxgxz,/r/Spanish/comments/bcum80/did_it_lie_though/eku6skr/,9,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE
VGM123,intermediate,"The preterite and imperfect tenses are notoriously annoying for Spanish learners, but that's because many teachers can't adequately explain them. Fortunately, once you get the logic of the two past tenses, then it will be easy to know when to use them at least 95% of the time.

\&gt; I was watching a post-match interview with a Peruvian soccer player talking about a game. I specifically remember him saying ""fuimos el  equipo superior"". I was confused, why didn't he say ""eramos""? I thought  you only use preterit when talking about a specific instance, but I  would assume the player would still believe that they still were the  superior team, and thus not limited to a specific moment when they were  superior.

The soccer player was referring to his team's performance during the game, which had a definite beginning and end. Thus, the preterite is required.

\&gt; Same problem as the fue/era, one would assume dinner continued to be delicious and someone is not just referring to a specific instance where  all of a sudden dinner was delicious.

The logic here is that the act of eating the dinner has a definite beginning and end, so the preterite is required. Now, if you were to say, ""My grandmother's dinners were always delicious when I was a kid"", you would use the imperfect tense for BOTH verbs in that sentence. In the sentence that you provided, however, the imperfect is not necessary.

\&gt; (also sub-question: why do many native speakers say ""Era broma"" vs ""Era UNA broma""?)

Spanish has some instances where a definite or indefinite article is not needed. This is one of them. I know it's tricky.

\&gt; This one is especially confusing because they seem to have the exact same  (or very similar) scenarios, something being a joke vs something being an accident. Yet they differ in that one uses era and the other uses fue.

Jokes can last indefinitely. Accidents can not. The existence of a joke doesn't have a definite beginning and end, but the existence of an accident does. Thus, imperfect for the joke, and preterite for the accident.

\&gt; I actually use this correctly when speaking, but when I think about it,  it doesn't make any sense. If someone was sick on friday, I get the  assumption that they are no longer sick and they are referring to a  specific instance of when they were sick (friday). So why wouldn't you  use estuvo instead?

The imperfect is also used for feeling states, which makes sense because those don't have definite beginnings and ends, either. Unless you were to state how long you were sick (e.g. ""I was throwing up for five hours""), then you would use the imperfect.

RYU_INU,dele b2,"I appreciate OP's review as a finely written set of experiences and also /u/imk's response. The number of C-level students is far lower in contrast than the other levels, so marginal attention is given to its instruction. I suspect that between B2 and C1 exists an invisible, if major change in the relationship between the language and the learner: that at C1, the person is no longer \*learning\* the language but instead \*learning to create with it.\* I think of this as an apprentice who learns first how the tools of their trade function, then passes into the trade itself when they use those tools in order to create something new. 

I attended a private language school in la CDMX in order to better prepare for the DELE C1 exam. I was the sole C-level student in the group, so the school split my time into two parts: the first part of the day I spent with B1-B2 learners and the second part of the day was one-on-one with a C-level instructor. The B-level time was filled with nice people but largely a waste of time (a major percentage of the lessons were conducted in English in order to explain grammar points) . 

The C-level was exactly what I had hoped to get. The instructor allowed/pushed me to use the language in order to communicate ideas and explore culture. This came out of, in part, the ""pedagogical energy"" that /u/ankiquestions wrote in their follow-up comment. For example, if we were to talk about dating culture in México then she would give me a list of expressions/words to review for that conversation while I had to come to class with a list of my own. We would first talk about our respective lists and then, once I was clear about their usage, she expected me to use them during our conversation. She would take notes, including new expressions/words that came out of our chat, that she then gave to me to review on my own. In that way, we had an intercambio within the class.

Check out the DELE levels (I’ll reference [A2](https://www.dele.org/?page=dele/level-a2) because I’d guess you’re likely around this level or striving for it, depending on how many hours you’ve been studying). You’ll notice that all of these levels have very specific goals for what you are hoping to achieve on your journey.  This frame of reference can be helpful to keep one grounded and provide benchmarks. At A2 one is focused on “commonly used, everyday expressions related to areas of experience relevant to them (basic information about themselves and their families, shopping, places of interest, work, etc)”.  When you approach it this way, now you don’t have to worry about the thousands upon thousands of words (or conversational scenarios) that exist out in the world, and instead you can hone in on these basics that are most important for your language at the level you are at today.  They also publish study books designed around these levels.

Another motivation tool that I use is that I track my hours in excel. This isn’t for everybody and if it’s going to take the fun out of it, don’t do it.  What I do is have one tab where I write down the approximate minutes of study, activity (ie. podcast, youtube/netflix, book, language exchange, lesson, etc.) and my categories (reading, listening, speaking, writing, vocab, pronunciation, homework/grammar). Doing this allows me to see my progression bit by bit – even if I might feel “stuck” every so often, I can look at these hours, recognize that I’m working hard, and based on research of hours recommended to reach the various Dele levels, use the recommended hours as motivation to keep moving forward with my studies (I record my hours each month – and overall - in a second tab).

As far as suggestions, the grammar acquisition might be brute force from a teacher/self-study book or similar.  But outside of that, you can find some good YouTube channels or podcasts where the teachers speak slowly, and make these a part of your learning routine; you will see your comprehension improve if you keep at the listening. If you can estimate your Dele level, there are graded reader books that are edited to make the reading more suitable for the appropriate level. Finally, maybe keep a small notebook in your pocket where you can jot down words you don’t know that you encounter in your life and conversations.

Of course, the thing is that they are not always wrong, there are people who will make fun of their accent. Those people are assholes.

imk,learner,"Rosetta Stone is useful for people who are starting at zero and want to avoid the whole academic route, but I would add some basic grammar study to go along with it. Their whole approach to teaching grammar is basically crap. ""You learn like a child"", sorry but that ship sailed a long time ago. Anyway, if you have the money, give it a shot. If you don't have much money, don't bother and stick with Duolingo.

The main thing that is helpful with Rosetta Stone is that they have online tutoring with native speakers which can be very helpful. Of course, that can also be done via tutoring platforms like iTalki and Verbling and with those sites you will be getting a tutor to yourself. I recommend that along with other things.

My recommendation is that you get some cheap but effective workbooks, The Practice Makes Perfect ones by Dorothy Richmond are very good and are available at most book stores or on Amazon. That will get you started on grammar and vocab. Online sites like Duolingo and [Conjuguemos](https://conjuguemos.com/) are great for practicing your conjugation and sentence construction. Rosetta Stone is pretty good for pronunciation, but even better would be arranging some classes with a tutor (as a beginner, don't worry too much about which country.

My daughter took 3 years of Spanish in an ""excellent"" school system and she ended up having to restudy the same things over and over because all the kids came back from summer having forgotten everything.

You might want to create some flash card app files on [Memrise (Decks](https://decks.memrise.com/home/) now I think) or something similar to keep drilling on the vocabulary you run into. You can also use the ones that are already there. There were some pre-existing courses there of common sayings, expressions and phrases that are really great.

You might want to invest in Dorothy Richmond's *Verb Tenses* workbook. It is around 11$ and can be great for learning and practicing grammar.

plavitch,learner,"I started teaching myself Spanish using Duolingo and the Complete Spanish audio course from Language Transfer. I dabbled with some other audio courses but LT fit me best. A couple of YouTube channels I found useful at the beginning are Señor Jordan (especially his series Learn Spanish with El Mono) and BookBox Spanish (lots of easy stories). I also used the Beelinguapp for reading parallel/bilingual stories. Some of their stories are for purchase but there are plenty that are free. There are also many websites that will help with grammar explanations. One that I remember specifically is [StudySpanish.com](https://StudySpanish.com). I made sure I knew the most common/useful X number of verbs and could conjugate them correctly. I bought an app to help me practice the verbs but there are sites like [conjuguemos.com](https://conjuguemos.com) you can use for that. At some point I watched the series ""Destinos"". It's old but I found it helpful. I tried watching the series ""Extr@"", but it didn't appeal to me.

While I was doing those things I was also contructing my personal Anki deck. Anything that confused me or that I thought needed more practice got a card. Almost all my cards were cloze deletion type cards, and I used the Fluent Forever philosophy of ""target language only"". I made cards for vocabulary and grammar. There were many cards that made me decide between ser and estar, for example, and know the correct preposition to use.

As I got better there were two things that really helped me make a big jump in my level. The first was writing regularly on Lang-8. I got corrections from native speakers, studied them closely, and make Anki cards when needed. Unfortunately Lang-8 is not an option for new users nowadays, but you can do the same thing on italki. The other thing that helped me was hiring tutors on italki. Yes, this costs some money, but Spanish-speaking community tutors can be found for cheap and there is nothing like one-on-one interaction. Again I would take my corrections and new vocabulary and add them to Anki.

Now, four or five years later, I think I'm a decent intermediate in the language and I don't really study much. I read every day (usually the news but also social networking sites) and I listen every day (radio, podcasts, news, YouTube videos, TV series). I also use the HelloTalk app to practice my texting and make occasional voice calls. One thing I will say about subtitles is that I think you should always use Spanish audio with Spanish subtitles. If one of those is in English you will just end up ignoring the Spanish completely.

Anyway, that's my learning story. Don't be afraid to change what you are doing to help fight boredom. For me it was switching back and forth between Duolingo and Language Transfer. Don't worry about ""streaks"" in a particular app. Just make sure to do something every day. You will get better. It's never going to be a straight-line ""every day I am better than the day before"", but long-term it will happen.",,1562673266,FALSE,t3_cavz4t,TRUE,t3_cavz4t,/r/Spanish/comments/cavz4t/need_advice_on_how_to_learn_spanish_on_my_own/etc2p44/,7,Spanish,t5_2qtt1,TRUE,TRUE

Barcelona_Dreaming,c2 euro spanish,"This article is very well done with clear examples in Spanish and nice explanations of context in English for tú/Ud usage in Spain!  It gives very explicit guidelines for tú vs Ud. and gives a bit of a historical and cross-oceanic perspective as well, though of course the focus is on current usage in Spain.

vLolo,c1,"  I do not believe that the linguistic differences that exist between these two deviants is so great that you should not pursue watching those shows.

A great catalyst for learning can be the passion that runs behind it, if you really enjoy those shows--watch them.

I have just returned from a two-month stay in the south of Spain and I can say that though there are some differences, there are not sufficient to cause worry.

""It will be observed that in the Nosotros and Vosotros forms the last letter of the verb is dropped before the addition of the reflexive pronoun in the affirmative imperative.""

levantarse (to get up, stand up) | Affirmative Imperative |

As you see, we don't say *levantamosnos,*
but instead, remove the **s** (last letter of the verb) in nos levantamo**s** and subsequently add **nos**, thus forming levantémonos.
